# Internal Documentation

This section of Img2Num is a centralized hub for developers, contributors, and curious users who want to explore the implementation details of the project.
This section focuses on **how the code and the project in its entirety works**.

Whether you are looking for WebAssembly APIs, React component details, or utility functions, this section serves as your authoritative guide.

:::warning Not Public API
The content here is for **internal use only**, meaning that it won't be useful if you are looking to use the library in your own project.

The [Introduction Page](../introduction) will help you find the correct part of the site for you.

## Purpose

This documentation serves three main goals:

1. **Quick Reference:** Quickly understand functions, components, and modules to integrate or use them correctly.
2. **Contributor Guide:** Provide a consistent structure for writing future documentation, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
3. **Technical Insight:** Offer low-level explanations, usage examples, and internal conventions to facilitate debugging, extension, or optimization.

## What You Will Find Here

- [Core docs](./core)
- [Bindings](./bindings)
- [Example app documentation](./example-apps)
- [Internal package docs](./packages)
- [Development tools](./tools) (e.g., CLI scripts & workflows)
- Brief explanations of the theory behind each part of the project

## How the Section is Organized

We aim to match the structure of the repository to ensure the relevant docs are easy to find.

## Guidelines for Writing Reference Docs

- **Clarity and Consistency:** Use a consistent style for describing functions, props, parameters, and returns.
- **Code Examples:** Show usage examples for each module or component; emphasize integration patterns.
- **Cross-Linking:** Link to guides, concepts, or architecture notes where relevant.
- **Scalability:** Use this page as a template for future additions — every new module or component should follow this structure.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Include meaningful titles, descriptions, and keywords in frontmatter and content.

## Navigation Tips

- Start here to **understand the structure and conventions** of the reference section.
- Follow links within the section to dive into specific modules or components.
- Use reference documentation alongside **Guides** and **Concepts** for complete understanding.
