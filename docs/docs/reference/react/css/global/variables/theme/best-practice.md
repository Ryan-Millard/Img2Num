:::tip Do
- Use CSS variables for all colors to ensure theme compatibility
- Use spacing variables for consistent spacing across the app
- Use border radius variables for consistent rounded corners
- Test components in both light and dark themes
:::

:::danger Don't
- Hardcode color values (e.g., `color: #ff0000`)
- Use arbitrary spacing values (e.g., `padding: 13px`)
- Override theme colors with `!important` unless absolutely necessary
- Assume the theme will always be light
