Img2Num provides several `npm scripts` that help with development, building, formatting, and documentation.

This section explains each script category in detail:

- Development scripts
- WASM build scripts (handled by the [orchestrator Makefile](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/blob/main/src/wasm/Makefile), but wrapped by `npm` in `package.json`)
- Build & preview scripts
- Cleanup scripts
- Formatting scripts
- Linting scripts
- Documentation scripts

Use these pages to understand how each script fits into the workflow.
