To keep issues clear, actionable, and easy to triage, we provide templates for contributors. Always use the appropriate template when creating a new issue.

### Templates

| Template                                 | Description                                                                                             | Labels           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Bug Report**                           | Report a bug in the code or functionality. Fill out all fields to help maintainers reproduce the issue. | bug              |
| **New Feature**                          | Request a new feature or enhancement. Provide clear motivation and expected behavior.                   | feature          |
| **Good First Issue**                     | Labelled issues ideal for new contributors. Great starting point to get familiar with the project.      | good first issue |
| **Refactor or Code Quality Improvement** | Request or suggest refactoring of existing code for maintainability or performance.                     | refactor         |
| **Blank Issue**                          | Use when the other templates don't fit your issue's description (try not to use this one).              | misc             |

### Guidelines

- Choose the most appropriate template for your issue.
- Fill out all required fields in the template.
- Provide screenshots, logs, or code snippets when applicable.
- Reference related issues or pull requests, e.g., `Fixes #123`.
