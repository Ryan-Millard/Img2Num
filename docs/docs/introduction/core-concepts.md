# Core Concepts of Img2Num

Understanding these ideas will help you get the most out of Img2Num:

## Color Palette

- Img2Num automatically generates a palette of colors based on the chosen image.
  - This is done by the K-Means function inside the WebAssembly module.

## Numbered Template

- Each color is assigned a number.
- The template shows numbers instead of colors, so you can color by number digitally or on paper.

## Interactive Coloring

- Click/tap to fill colors.
- Undo or reset your template at any time.
