# ⚠️ Important Notice: Documentation Incomplete

The repository was recently refactored in [PR #250](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/pull/250).
Some documentation pages may be missing, outdated, or incomplete.

We are actively updating the docs to match the new structure, but we could really use your help!

## How you can help

- Contributions to the docs are **very welcome** — if you’d like to help, you can submit a pull request for improvements (reference this in the PR body).

Your contributions help keep the documentation accurate and up-to-date, and make it easier for everyone to use Img2Num. Thank you for your support!
