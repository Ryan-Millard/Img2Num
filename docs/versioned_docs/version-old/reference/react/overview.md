# React Reference

This section documents **React components, hooks, and context providers** in Img2Num.

## Current Categories

- **UI Components**: Visual elements, layouts, and controls used in the frontend.
- **WASM Wrappers**: React hooks or components that interface with WASM modules.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for state management, effects, or data fetching.

## Guidelines

- Document each component/hook with:
  - Props or parameters
  - Example usage
  - Integration with WASM modules (if applicable)
  - Notes on styling or context requirements

:::tip Contributor Tip
Keep components modular and document any external dependencies clearly.
