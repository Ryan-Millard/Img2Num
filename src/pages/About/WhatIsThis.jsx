          Img2Num
        </a>{' '}
        is a web-based tool that transforms any image into a <strong>colour-by-number template</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using advanced image processing, the website analyses the colours in your image and breaks it down into a
        numbered palette.
      </p>

      <img src={coverHedge} alt="hedgehog" className={styles.coverImage} />

      <p>Img2Num is designed for everyone—friends, family, or solo users who enjoy colouring.</p>

      <p>
        Beyond being a creative tool, Img2Num also carries a personal touch. The hedgehog-themed UI is a tribute to
        Joan, the hedgehog who inspired many of the design elements on this site. It’s a blend of{' '}
        <strong>technology, art, and memory</strong>, offering a unique colouring experience unlike any other.
