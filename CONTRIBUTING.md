## Code of Conduct

Please review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help foster an open and welcoming environment.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue at:


https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/issues


*When reporting issues:*

* Use a descriptive title.
* Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
* Attach screenshots or logs if applicable.
* Specify your environment (OS, Node.js version, browser).

## Development Setup

1. *Clone the repository*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num.git
   cd Img2Num
   

2. *Install dependencies*

   bash
   npm install
   

3. *Prerequisites*

   * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 16.x)
   * [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) (emcc in your PATH)
   * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or compatible build system
   * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (installed via npm install)

## Building the Project

### WASM Components

The C++ code under src/wasm is compiled to WebAssembly.

* *Build release WASM*

  bash
  npm run build-wasm
  

* *Build debug WASM* (with debug symbols)

  bash
  npm run build-wasm:debug
  

* *Clean WASM artifacts*

  bash
  npm run clean-wasm
  

> These scripts invoke the Makefile in src/wasm (see make -C src/wasm help).

### Frontend (React + Vite)

* *Development build*

  bash
  npm run dev
  

* *Development with debug WASM*

  bash
  npm run dev:debug
  

* *Production build*

  bash
  npm run build
  

* *Preview production build*

  bash
  npm run preview
  

* *Clean all build artifacts*

  bash
  npm run clean
  

## Running the Application

After building, launch the dev server:

bash
npm run dev


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or as indicated in the console).

## Linting & Formatting

We use ESLint to maintain code quality.

* *Run linter*

  bash
  npm run lint
  

* *Auto-fix lint issues*

  bash
  npm run lint:fix
  

Our ESLint configuration is in eslint.config.js. Please ensure all lint checks pass before submitting a PR.

## Testing & Debugging

Currently, there are no formal tests. Use browser dev tools and logging for debugging. Contributions to add unit or integration tests are welcome!

## Commit Guidelines

* Write clear, concise commit messages in the format:

  
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>

  <body>
  

  * *type*: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
  * *scope*: area of the code (e.g., wasm, frontend)
  * *subject*: brief description

* Reference issues when applicable: Fixes #123.

* Keep pull requests focused and small.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:

   bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   
2. Commit changes to your branch.
3. Push to your fork:

   bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   
4. Open a pull request against main with a descriptive title and description.
5. Wait for review. Address feedback by pushing additional commits.
