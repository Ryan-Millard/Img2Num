# Contributing to Img2Num

Want to contribute to Img2Num? There are a few things you need to know.

We wrote a [contribution guide](https://ryan-millard.github.io/Img2Num/info/docs/introduction/contributing) to help you get started.

**A few important points:**

- **Add tests** with your PR — new features and bug fixes **must** include tests where appropriate. PRs without tests are unlikely to be approved.
- Follow the repository's coding style rules.
- Use the issue and PR templates when filing issues or submitting code. Your PR will be rejected if you don't.

If you're unsure what to change, [open a discussion](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/discussions/new/choose) and someone will assist you.
