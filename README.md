# Img2Num 🖼️➞️🎨

**Img2Num** is a React + WebAssembly-based application that allows users to upload an image and convert it into a **colour-by-number** version that can be either printed or coloured in directly within the browser. It's designed to be fast, efficient, and interactive, leveraging C++ (compiled to WebAssembly) for pixel manipulation.

---

## Goal
> To make a fast, offline, serverless application that runs at near-native speeds, enabling in-browser colouring or printing of the image.

---

## ✨ Features

* Upload an image (e.g. PNG, JPG)
* Convert it into a colour-by-number version
* Preview the simplified image directly in the browser
* Print-friendly output for physical colouring
* In-browser colouring support
* Fast image processing using WebAssembly and C++

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads an image.
2. The image is processed into raw pixel data in JavaScript.
3. That data is passed to WebAssembly (C++) for transformation.
4. The output is a simplified, indexed version of the image.
5. A **K-Means Clustering** algorithm is used to reduce colours to a small, distinct palette.
6. The output is rendered on a `<canvas>` and optionally made printable.

## 🛠️ Development

### 🧱 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes `npm`)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  *(Installed automatically via `npm install`, but you can install globally with `npm install -g vite` for convenience)*
* [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
  *(Ensure `emcc` is available in your `PATH`)*
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or compatible build system

### 📅 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/img2num.git
cd img2num
npm install
```

### 🚀 Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This builds the WASM modules and starts the Vite dev server.

### 🔪 Debug Mode

```bash
npm run dev:debug
```

## 🔮 Algorithm Plan: K-Means Clustering

We plan to use K-Means Clustering to reduce the number of unique colours in the uploaded image to a more manageable, user-defined number (e.g., 4–12 colours). These clustered colours will be used as the numbered colour palette for the final output.

---

## 🖨️ Print Mode (Planned)

We're planning to add a clean, print-friendly version of the colour-by-number output so that users can:

* Print the image
* View the legend with colour numbers
* Colour it in manually
