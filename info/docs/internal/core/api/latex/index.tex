\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
This is the heart of Img2\+Num. All implementations start here and are built upwards using this framework of functions and libraries. C++ developers include this library directly, C developers include a lightweight wrapper around it, and Java\+Script developers import a safe wrapper that protects them from manual memory management.

The main raster image vectorization functions are located in this part of the library—\+FFTs, contour tracing, blurring, and much more.\hypertarget{index_features_sec}{}\doxysection{Key Features}\label{index_features_sec}
All public functions are exported from {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{img2num_8h}{img2num.\+h}}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Image processing algorithms (FFT, Contour Tracing, etc.)
\item Memory management utilities
\item Cross-\/platform compatibility
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_building_sec}{}\doxysection{Building Img2\+Num}\label{index_building_sec}
To build the project, follow these instructions\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/B build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
To install the library, use the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install build}

\end{DoxyCode}


The library and headers will be installed as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Libraries}} are installed to {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib}
\item {\bfseries{Headers}} are installed to {\ttfamily /usr/local/include}
\end{DoxyItemize}

To link to the library in your CMake project, use\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(Img2Num REQUIRED)}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(your\_app PRIVATE Img2Num)}

\end{DoxyCode}
