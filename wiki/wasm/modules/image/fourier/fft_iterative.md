# 1. Overview

The **iterative FFT** is an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm that:

* Avoids recursion (unlike classic divide-and-conquer recursive FFT).
* Computes an \$N\$-point DFT in \$O(N \log N)\$ time.
* Uses in-place updates to minimize memory allocations.

**High-level steps:**

1. Reorder input array using **bit-reversal permutation**.
2. Iteratively apply **butterfly operations** across log₂(N) stages.
3. Multiply by **twiddle factors** ($$e^{\frac{-2πi k}{N}}$$) to combine sub-DFTs.
4. Normalize for the inverse FFT.

# 2. Iterative FFT vs Recursive FFT

| Feature                   | Recursive FFT                        | Iterative FFT                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Memory usage**          | O(N log N) call stack                | O(N) in-place                     |
| **Function calls**        | Recursive function calls             | Simple loop over stages           |
| **Performance**           | Extra overhead due to recursion      | Slightly faster, cache-friendly   |
| **Ease of understanding** | Conceptually simple                  | Slightly more complex indexing    |
| **Flexibility**           | Easy to visualize divide-and-conquer | Better for repeated or large FFTs |

The iterative approach is chosen here for **performance and low memory overhead**, especially important when processing many signals or images in memory.

# 3. Bit-Reversal Permutation

**Purpose:**

Before applying the iterative butterfly operations, the input array must be **reordered so that the indices correspond to the bit-reversed order** of their original index.

* Example: For N=8, binary indices:

| Original Index (binary) | Bit-Reversed Index (binary) | Decimal |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| 000                     | 000                         | 0       |
| 001                     | 100                         | 4       |
| 010                     | 010                         | 2       |
| 011                     | 110                         | 6       |
| 100                     | 001                         | 1       |
| 101                     | 101                         | 5       |
| 110                     | 011                         | 3       |
| 111                     | 111                         | 7       |

* Reordering ensures that the iterative algorithm can **process butterflies in a linear pass** without recursion.
* Each butterfly stage combines elements separated by certain distances; bit-reversal guarantees that the data for each stage are contiguous in memory.

**Why it matters:**

Without bit-reversal, iterative FFT cannot correctly combine the sub-transforms, and the resulting frequency spectrum would be scrambled.

> [!NOTE]
> Bit-reversal effectively separates and reorders the data in a way similar to the even/odd splitting in the recursive DFT, allowing the iterative FFT to combine sub-transforms efficiently.

# 4. Butterfly Operations

A **butterfly** is the core computation of the FFT:

Given two inputs `u` and `v`:

$$
y_0 = u + w \cdot v
$$

$$
y_1 = u - w \cdot v
$$

Where `w` is a **twiddle factor** ($$e^{\frac{-2πi k}{N}}$$).

**Explanation:**

* Each butterfly combines two elements from a smaller DFT to form part of a larger DFT.
* At stage `s` of the FFT:

  * Each group has size `m = 2^s`.
  * Half of the elements are combined with the other half using the corresponding twiddle factor.

* All stages are applied iteratively, doubling the sub-transform size each time.

# 5. Twiddle Factors

**Definition:**

Twiddle factors are complex exponentials:

$$
W_N^k = e^{-2\pi i k / N}
$$

* They encode the **phase rotation** needed to combine sub-DFTs at each stage.
* Precomputing twiddle factors per stage improves efficiency.

**Why we need them:**

* Each butterfly combines values that are separated in the original signal; the twiddle factor rotates one of the values so that they **sum correctly in the frequency domain**.
* For the inverse FFT, conjugate the twiddle factor to reverse rotation.

---

# 6. Inverse Transform and Normalization

* **Forward FFT:** no normalization (standard engineering convention).
* **Inverse FFT:** divide each element by N to recover original signal magnitude:

$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] e^{+2 \pi i k n / N}
$$

* In code: after completing the iterative FFT with conjugated twiddle factors, scale all output values by `1/N`.

# 7. Practical Notes / Optimizations

1. **In-place computation** reduces memory usage and cache misses.
2. **Avoid recursion** to prevent stack overflows for large N.
3. **Stage-wise twiddle computation** allows reuse, instead of computing $$e^{\frac{-2πik}{N}}$$ every iteration.
4. **Power-of-two input length** is required for Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT. Zero-pad if necessary.
5. **Real-input optimization:** For purely real signals, only half the spectrum needs explicit computation (optional).
6. **2D FFTs:** Apply 1D FFT along rows, then columns (separable property).

> Iterative FFT efficiently computes the DFT using these key steps. Each step—bit-reversal, butterfly operations, and twiddle factor multiplication—corresponds directly to the mathematical structure of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm. Avoiding recursion and using in-place computation keeps it memory- and cache-efficient, which is crucial for large signals or image processing pipelines.
